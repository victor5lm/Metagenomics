Follow the workflow of this tutorial for the taxonomic binning of the virome reads and contigs used as homework in the unit_3.

>Reads from unit_3 homework are paired_end reads. To perform this task you can do it in several ways; joining all decontaminated and QF reads and then run DIAMOND or run DIAMOND using both files and then join DIAMOND outputs, etc..

Write a brief summary describing the bioinformatic pipeline you have followed (trimming, decontamination, improve in quality, number of reads remove in each step, etc.) and the most relevant results (two figures maximun) with the taxonomy assessment of the virome at family level.

**Optional**: run the same analysis but using the assembled contigs and try to compare the results using MEGAN (File/Compare and load both rma6 files created while making the individual analysis).
