Repeat all the steps with a viral metagenome from a human saliva sample (Virome.zip in Unit 3 of Moodle). Compare different de novo assemblies options (try _--meta--) or different kmer values. You must perform at least 3 different assemblies. Write a brief summary describing the bioinformatic pipeline you have followed (trimming, decontamination, improve in quality, number of reads remove in each step, etc.). Compare different de novo assemblies with QUAST and choose the best based on the obtained metrics (smaller number of contigs, higher N50, smaller L50, longest total assembly length, etc.).

>NOTE: In the quality filtering step, modify the MINLEN argument considering the original read length. Consider that reads with a minimum of 50% of the average original size are ok for subsequent analyses.

>NOTE: Importantly, you do not have a reference genome for a metagenome.
